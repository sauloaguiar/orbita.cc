Programming challenge

Evaluation Criteria
 - Working Solution
 - Project organization
 - Clean code (both css and js)
 - Deployment

 Description
  The challenge consists of constructing a full software solution to visualize data in a dynamic webpage. In order to achieve this, you will import a given set of data (look for the solar_data.csv file in the data folder) into a database and expose it through a rest api using a node.js server.
  The server should implement user access control and expose data only to logged users. You can implement it using whatever mechanism you prefer (token or session based, for instance).


Restrictions
  Front end should be done using a SPA framework (preferably React.js)
  Back end should be done using node.js
